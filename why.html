<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I love coding, I love producing things. And for me, coding is the best tool for that.<br>

<h4>Your Life</h4>
<p>
Your life is, your life <br>
Don't let it be clubbed into dank submission.<br>
Be on the watch <br>
There are ways out. There is a light somewhere.<br>
It may not be much light, but it beats the darkness.<br>
Be on the watch.<br>
The god will offer you chances.<br>
Know them. <br>
Take them. <br>
You can't beat death but, you can beat death in life, sometimes. <br>
And more often you learn to do it, the more lights there will be. <br>
Your life is your life. <br>
Know it, while you have it. <br>
You are marvelous. <br>
The god wait to delight, in you. <br>
If you're going to try, go all the way. <br>
Otherwise, don't even start. <br>
If you're going to try, go all the way. <br>
This could mean losing girlfriends, <br>
wives, relatives, jobs and maybe your mind. <br>
go all the way. <br>
It could mean not eating for three or four days. <br>
It could mean freezing on a park bench. <br>
It could mean jail,it could mean division, mockery, isolation. <br>
Isolation is the gift. <br>
All the other are a test of your endurance. <br>
Of how much you realy want to do it. <br>
And you do it. <br>
Despite rjection and the worst odds, <br>
and it will be better than anything else you can imagine. <br>
If you're going to try, go all the way. <br>
There is no other feeling like that. <br>
You will be alone with the god and the knights and flay and the fire. <br>
Do it. Do it. Do it. <br>
All the way. All the way. <br>
You will ride life straight to the perfect laughter. <br>
It's the only good fight there is. <br>
